# Charts

This is an example project to show usage of different charting libraries in angular. Currently it shows rendering charts using Chart.js, HighCharts, and D3. It also shows that different charting libraries can be lazy loaded a long with the angular modules. For example, the D3 library is lazy loaded with the "D3ChartsModules"

## Development server
